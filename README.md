Short Job First Live- Shortest Process time is processed first 
Shortest Job First (SJF) is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive.
It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution. The full form of SJF is Shortest Job First.
